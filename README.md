 Afer that, go to [the dashboard](https://frii.site/dashboard), and register a new domain by typing your domain (ex: super-awesome-domain.frii.site) to the "Register a new domain" field, then click the magnification glass icon. Make sure to refresh the page after this to show the changes

 Make sure to set a value that is appropriate for each type. Hit the "save" button after this.
