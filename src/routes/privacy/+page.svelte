		Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact
		us.
	</p>
	<p>

	<p><strong>Sensitive Information.</strong> We do not process sensitive information.</p>

		All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and
		you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.

	<p><strong>Information automatically collected</strong></p>
	<p>
		<strong>In Short:</strong> <strong> </strong> Some information - such as your Internet Protocol
		(IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics - is collected automatically when you
		visit our Services.
	</p>
	<p>
		We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services.
		This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact
		information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser
		and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device
		name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other
		technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and
		operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

	<p>The information we collect includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and

			Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this
			log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and
			information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated
			with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as
			which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error
			reports (sometimes called 'crash dumps'), and hardware settings).
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's
			location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect
			depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For
			example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us
			your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to
			collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling
			your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be
			able to use certain aspects of the Services.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
	<p>
		<strong>In Short: </strong> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our
		Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We

		<strong
			>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you

			<strong>To save or protect an individual's vital interest.</strong> We may process your information
			when necessary to save or protect an individual's vital interest, such as to prevent harm.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
	<p>
		<strong>In Short: </strong>We only process your personal information when we believe it is
		necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law,
		like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or
		fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate
		business interests.
	</p>
	<p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
	<p>
		The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid
		legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely
		on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Consent. </strong>We may process your information if you have given us
			permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You
			can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about
			<a href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent</a> .
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is
			necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement
			body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information
			as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is
			necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as
			situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
	<p>
		We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express
		consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where
		your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can <a href="#withdrawconsent"
			>withdraw your consent</a> at any time.
	</p>
	<p>
		In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your
		information without your consent, including, for example:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be
			obtained in a timely way
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess,
			process, or settle an insurance claim
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of
			financial abuse
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the
			availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for
			purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the
			laws of Canada or a province
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of
			the court relating to the production of records
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or
			profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information
			was produced
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
	</ul>

		The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications

		may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any
		guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage

		Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not
		responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third
		parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from
		the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly
		to respond to your questions.
	</p>
	<p><strong>6. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</strong></p>
	<p>
		<strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and
		store your information.
	</p>
	<p>

		We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes

		require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which
		users have an account with us .
	</p>
	<p>
		When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we

	</p>
	<p><strong>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
	<p>
		<strong>In Short: </strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational

	</p>
	<p>
		We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security
		measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However,
		despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
		over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so
		we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third
		parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
		modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
		transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You
		should only access the Services within a secure environment.
	</p>

		personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will
		deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our
		records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18,
		please contact us at contact@frii.site .

	</p>
	<p>

		applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and
		obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii)
		to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data
		portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain

		information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details
		provided in the section ' <a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a> '
		below.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection
		laws.

		If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your
		personal information, you also have the right to complain to your <a
			href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm"
			>Member State data protection authority</a>
		or
		<a
			href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/"
			>UK data protection authority</a> .

	<p>
		If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the <a
			href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html"

	<p>
		<strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your
		personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the
		applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw
		your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the
		section ' <a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a> ' below .
	</p>

	<p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>

		<strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept
		cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove
		cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could

	<p>
		If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at
		contact@frii.site.
	</p>
	<p><strong>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
	<p>
		Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
		Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
		not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
		stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been
		finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
		mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
		standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
		you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

	<p>
		Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the

		require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you
		have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we
		may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide
		with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication
		method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
		verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or
		authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional
		information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
		identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
		additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
		fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as
		we finish verifying you.

		<li>
			You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your personal information
